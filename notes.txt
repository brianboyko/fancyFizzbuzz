Output:

1 - 100 inclusive:

If the number's divisible 
by 3, print "Fizz!"

If the number's divisible by 
5, print "Buzz", 

If the number's divisible by 
15, print "Fizzbuzz"

Write Tests that safe to use at the upper bounds (largest numbers, negative numbers, edge cases)

Optimize the generator (so that if you're iterating over it, it will still be responsive.); 
  -- If someone external to the script is iterating over the returned enumeration,
  -- They may not choose to iterate over the entire collection. 
    -- If they say "Fizz Buzz 1-1000000" and they say "bomb out at 500", don't generate
	the numbers for 1000000"

Call mainFizzBuzz from an external script. 
(A secondary script that calls it, so it's treated like a true library
, and controls where the output goes.)...
	.. if I was using node to use a package, I'd have to call the fizzbuzzer.  

  Okay, 999999999999999 is the largest number I can reliably test in Javascript. That's 9 (mod 15), so we can start the fizzbuz counter at "fizz, buzz, num, fizz, num, num, fizzbuzz"
